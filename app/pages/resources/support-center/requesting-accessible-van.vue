This is for the safety of our drivers, passengers, and also for any kind of incident that may be caught with the external camera coverage. All video is reviewed if there is an incident and is utilized for training our drivers as the cameras also utilize AI to track how the drivers are driving and following specific protocol in place by the city, state, and internal company policies.</p>

                Unfortunately we are only able to accommodate when there is availability to do so. We suggest requesting the transportation 24-48 hours in advance at the minimum to increase the possibility for accommodation. If you really need the van you can request transportation a week in advance to try to secure that availability. We don't run into the issue with availability often but it is something to be aware of.

                If there are no accessible vans available we still have 40+ vehicles in our fleet to accommodate the trip but it would be with a vehicle that is less accommodating.
